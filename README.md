üì± Screenshots
To add screenshots, simply take some from your simulator and upload them to a /screenshots folder in your repository. Then, replace the placeholder URLs above with the correct path.

‚öôÔ∏è How to Run
Clone the repository:

Bash

git clone [your-repository-url]
Get an API Key:

Sign up for a free API key at NewsAPI.org.

Add Your API Key:

Create a file named Secrets.swift in the root of the project.
